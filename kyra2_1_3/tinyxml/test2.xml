<!-- [lee] This file basically contains test cases for bug reports.-->
<!-- The first 2 bugs (from Andrius)
	 1) The parser doesn't skip leading spaces in text fields.
	 2) empty comments are not handled correctly. -->

<text>"  This has leading spaces in quotes -- that should be preserved!"</text>
<text>  This has leading spaces that should go away</text>

<!-- This was causing an infinite loop. Comment back in to test (you
	 will get an error from the parser.) -->
<!--
	<Thing name="test" /> 
	a foolish comment 
	<Thing name="test2" />
