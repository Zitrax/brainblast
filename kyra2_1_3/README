The directories here comes from the package downloaded from:

http://gbgames.com/downloads/libraries/kyra2_1_3.tar.gz

mentioned in the thread:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/kyra/forums/forum/149869/topic/1680697

The original sources at https://sourceforge.net/projects/kyra/ does not seem to be maintained anylonger and the available package does not compile by default, therefore the fixed package has been added into the brainblast project.

You should be able to compile it by entering the kyra directory and run './autogen' and then 'make'.
