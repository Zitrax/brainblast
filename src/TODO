* Make an array or similar to keep the the puzzles in
  instead of if checks on the nmber of players.

* Make sure we do not crash when a level can not be 
  loaded.

* Show some progress indication on how correct your
  solution is.

* Perhaps we should only throw down pices that are
  actually used in the puzzle.

* Make sure you can not set two pieces on one place 
  in the lvl file.


=== Scoring ===

Boardsize*BrickTypes*#SolutionBricks

For example a 3x3 level with 3 bricks of 2 types would give the player
9*3*2=54 points per correct brick. And add a 10 multiplier for nicer
number, so 540 points per brick here.

Time bonus: 10 points per remaining second.

A brick inserted at the wrong location would give a penalty of the
brick score without the mltiplier. So on the board above a misplaced
brick would give 54 points in penalty.
