=== Optimizations ===

Currently drawing the text happens too often. If the text has not
changed and not been moved over we should not need to repaint it.
Also I should look into drawing the text with kyra itself, there seem
to be some font functions there.

=== Scoring ===

Boardsize*BrickTypes*#SolutionBricks

For example a 3x3 level with 3 bricks of 2 types would give the player
9*3*2=54 points per correct brick. And add a 10 multiplier for nicer
number, so 540 points per brick here.

Time bonus: 10 points per remaining second.

A brick inserted at the wrong location would give a penalty of the
brick score without the mltiplier. So on the board above a misplaced
brick would give 54 points in penalty.
