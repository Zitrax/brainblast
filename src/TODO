== To fix before first release 0.1 ==

* There should be a main screen to select mode and options

* There should be a high score table

* No timer in the score fields. One big centered for the initial timing
  and one smaller somewhere else (?)

* When finishing a level there should be a pause so you get what is happening
  also possibly with time bonus counted.

** And check memleaks and invalid reads

=================================

X Make an array or similar to keep the the puzzles in
  instead of if checks on the number of players.

* Make sure we do not crash when a level can not be 
  loaded.

X Show some progress indication on how correct your
  solution is.

X Perhaps we should only throw down pieces that are
  actually used in the puzzle.

X Make sure you can not set two pieces on one place 
  in the lvl file.

X You can overwrite correct pieces with correct or incorrect bricks. 

* In puzzle we have several ** variables that should be just a *.

X If the score goes down the text area is not cleared.

* There should be falling blocks to temporarily show the solution.

* There should be "joker-blocks" that is correct if put where there is
  a piece.

X Find music with suitable license.

* In two player mode, drop pieces which you could use to destroy a
  pice on the other players board.

* Cooperative two player mode.

* Falling bombs that scatter the bricks on ground or stuns the
  players.

X AI player.

* Make sure to show the correct solution on game over

* Dont score so high for large boards

=== Optimizations ===

Currently drawing the text happens too often. If the text has not
changed and not been moved over we should not need to repaint it.
Also I should look into drawing the text with kyra itself, there seem
to be some font functions there.

=== Scoring ===

Boardsize*BrickTypes*#SolutionBricks

For example a 3x3 level with 3 bricks of 2 types would give the player
9*3*2=54 points per correct brick. And add a 10 multiplier for nicer
number, so 540 points per brick here.

Time bonus: 10 points per remaining second.

A brick inserted at the wrong location would give a penalty of the
brick score without the mltiplier. So on the board above a misplaced
brick would give 54 points in penalty.
