* Make an array or similar to keep the the puzzles in
  instead of if checks on the nmber of players.

* Make sure we do not crash when a level can not be 
  loaded.

* Show some progress indication on how correct your
  solution is.

* Perhaps we should only throw down pices that are
  actually used in the puzzle.
